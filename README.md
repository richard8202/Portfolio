# Parralel Drone Computation and Communication with Apache Flink and Navio 2
  * Apache Flink is a framework for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. This allows for streams of data to be sent to the Flink cluster to be computed and transformed in real time. 
  * With the help of Emlid‚Äôs Navio2, an autopilot HAT for Raspberry Pi, the drones are able to send real-time sensor data that are on-board to the Flink cluster to allow for monitoring the status of each drone.
  * Each drone is assigned a task through Apache Flink, submitted by the master node. This allows the job to be executed in parallel rather than sequential, reducing latency.

# Modeling Energy Consumption and Price with Different Housing Configurations
  * This experiment intends to model how construction of a home with different building materials affect the internal temperature over time.
  * Using MATLAB these sets of data were used to create mathematical predictions of internal housing temperature for an entire year, as well as mathematical models of energy and power to be used for approximating the cost of keeping a similarly-constructed, average sized home cool.
  * For this particular experiment, multiple boxes were constructed to simulate the walls of a home. In this case a cubic wooden frame was constructed with an outer surface volume of around 7.6 ùëìùë°<sup>3<sup>

# Modeling and Interpolating Data of 2013 Honda Accord Sport
 * The objective of this project was to obtain data from a 2013 Honda Accord Sport and use mathematical equations inorder to create models and interpolations.
 * The Data pulled from the Honda Accord allowed us to interpolation the car's MPG,RPM,distance and speed.  
 * With the car, it ran 3 trials with the intent to start from rest and accelerate to 35 MPH then decelerate to 0 mph. To record our data we used an OBDII (ON BOARD DIAGNOSTICS) reader.

# Facial Recognition of Intel Neuarl Stick Benchmark
* A study and implementation of Intel‚Äôs Movidius Neural Compute Stick 2 with Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry 3. The two computers run facial detection software using the neural compute stick and compare the execution time, accuracy,and power consumed.
