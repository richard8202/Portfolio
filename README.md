# Parralel Drone Computation and Communication with Apache Flink and Navio 2
  * Apache Flink is a framework for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. This allows for streams of data to be sent to the Flink cluster to be computed and transformed in real time.
  * With the help of Emlid‚Äôs Navio2, an autopilot HAT for Raspberry Pi, the drones are able to send real-time sensor data that are on-board to the Flink cluster to allow for monitoring the status of each drone.
   
  
# Modeling Energy Consumption and price with Different Housing Configurations
  * This experiment intends to model how construction of a home with different building materials affect the internal temperature over time.
  * For this particular experiment, multiple boxes were constructed to simulate the walls of a home. In this case a cubic wooden frame was constructed with an outer surface volume of around 7.6 ùëìùë°<sup>3<sup>
  * Using MATLAB these sets of data were used to create mathematical predictions of internal housing temperature for an entire year, as well as mathematical models of energy and 
power to be used for approximating the cost of keeping a similarly-constructed, average sized home cool.
